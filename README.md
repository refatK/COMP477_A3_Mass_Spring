# Mass Spring System using Explicit Euler Method

![Project Sample Gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31963426/117589828-11178a00-b0fa-11eb-93e6-2690106302ea.gif)

## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to implement a basic physics systems involving point masses (represented by nodes) joined with springs. Spring force, gravity, and spring dampening are taken into account in these physics calculations. An external force can also be applied using the mouse by dragging a non-locked node.

## How to Run

Since this is a Qt Creator Project, QT Creator IDE should be installed. Once the projected is locally cloned or the source files downloaded, the project can be open using the `A3.pro` file which represents the Qt Project.

##  View Implementation Work

The project started with a given starter code, and the work done can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/refatK/P3_Mass_Spring_Euler/pull/1).
